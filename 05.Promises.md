# Using Promises

## Why do we need them

### Normal function and async function

```js
// Let's say we want to add two numbers
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```


```js
// Let's say we need to use a service to do the calculation
const result = getAddResultFromServer('http://www.example.com?x=1&y=2');
console.log(result); //undefined, since the request hasn't finished yet
```

Before promises we needed callbacks
```js
// add two numbers remotely
// get the result by calling an API

function addAsync (num1, num2, callback) {
    return $.getJSON('http://www.example.com', {
        num1: num1,
        num2: num2
    }, callback);
}

addAsync(1, 2, success) => {
    const result = success;
});
```

What happens if `result` is needed for other async operations?
```js

function addAsync (x, y, callback) {
    // use the famous jQuery getJSON callback API
    return $.getJSON('http://www.example.com', {
        x,
        y
    }, callback);
}

addAsync(1, 2, success => {
    // callback 1
    resultA = success; // you get result = 3 here

    addAsync(resultA, 3, success) => {
        // callback 2
        resultB = success; // you get result = 6 here

        addAsync(resultB, 4, success) => {
            // callback 3
            resultC = success; // you get result = 10 here

            console.log('total' + resultC);
            console.log(resultA, resultB, resultC);
        });
    });
});
```

The same with Promises
```js
let resultA, resultB, resultC;

function addAsync(num1, num2) {
    // use ES6 fetch API, which return a promise
    return fetch(`http://www.example.com?num1=${num1}&num2=${num2}`)
        .then(x => x.json());
}

// The return value of each .then() is used in the next .then()
addAsync(1, 2)
    .then(success => success)
    .then(success => addAsync(success, 3))
    .then(success => addAsync(success, 4))
    .then(success => console.log('total: ' + success));
```



##  What is a Promise exactly
[Using Promises on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Since most people are consumers of already-created promises, this guide will explain consumption of returned promises before explaining how to create them. Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

> "Imagine you are a kid. Your mom **promises** you that you'll get you a piece of cake at the end of the day."
>
> You *don't know* if you will get cake until the end of the day. Your mom can either *really* you a piece of cake, or *not* give you the cake if she is not happy :(.

A promise has three states:
1. *Pending*: You might, or not, get cake
2. *Fulfilled*: You got cake!
3. *Rejected*: The cake is a lie
