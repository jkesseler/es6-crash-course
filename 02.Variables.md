# Variables


## Hoisting
Hoisting is a mechanism where variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope.

```js
console.log(hoistedVariable); // undefined
var hoistedVariable = "I'm hoisted";
```


## Three ways  declaring a variable
```js
var myVar;
let myOtherVar;
const myConst = [];
```


## `var` vs. `let` vs. `const`
### `var`
The scope of variables declared with `var` is the current *execution context*. Either the function they are in or the global scope.
```js
var i = 36;

function aFunction() {
  var i = 22;

  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
  }
  console.log(i); // 10
}
aFunction();

console.log(i); // 36
```

### `let` is block-level scoped
A variable declared with `let` is hoisted to the nearest block scope
```js
const aFunction = () => {
  let i = 22;

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
  }
  console.log(i); // 22
}
aFunction();
```

### `const`
With `const` a variable is declared that cannot be re-assigned. There for it must be assigned immediately.
`const` is block-level scoped.

```js
const myObj = {};
const myObj = []; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'myObj' has already been declared
```

However `const` is not immutable
```js

const myObj = {}:
myObj.someProperty = '123';
console.log(myObj.someProperty); // 123
```

If you want to make a `const` value immutable you can do so yourself with `Object.freeze()`.

```js
const myObj = Object.freeze({});
myObj.someProperty = '123';
console.log(myObj.someProperty); // undefined
```
> Gotcha: When not in strict mode mutating a frozen object fails silently
> It does not trow a TypeError

```js
'use strict'; // Tell the runtime to execute in "strict mode"
const myObj = Object.freeze({});
myObj.someProperty = '123'; // TypeError
```

## Gotcha
Variables that are assigned but not previously initiated are added to the global scope
```js
function aFunction() {
  someVar = 'some value';
}
aFunction();
console.log(someVar); // 'some value'
```

## Temporal Dead Zone
Take the following code:

```js
console.log(myVar); // undefined. The variable exist but it's value is `undefined`
console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: myLet is not defined
var myVar = 'A var';
let myLet = 'A let';
```
It looks like the `let` declaration is not hoisted because it does not exist yet.
While in fact it is hoisted. There is a period between entering scope where they
cannot be accessed and being declared. This period is called the "Temporal Dead Zone".
