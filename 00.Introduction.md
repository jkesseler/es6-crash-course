# ES6 Crash Course
Most commonly used ES6 features.

## What is ES?
*ECMAScript* is a standard, while *JavaScript* is the most popular implementation of that standard. Both are used interchangeably. When people say ES6 they usually mean javascript based on the ES standard from 2015 and later. We are going to call it ES6 wether or not this is technically the correct name.


## Evolving the standard
The Ecma TC39 committee is responsible for evolving the ES standard. New features are added via a the TC39 Process, with stages.

- Stage 0: A new idea is submitted
- Stage 1: Someone (called a champion) is made responsible for a formal proposal
- Stage 2: Draft version of the proposal is added to the spec, two experimental implementations have to be made.
- Stage 3: Proposal is finished and reviewed. At least 2 spec compliant implementations have to be made.
- Stage 4: Officially added to the standard

If a new feature hits stage two is't very likely to be added to the standard.

## implementations
JavaScript is an implementation of the standard. There are many javascript engines, not all on the same level of feature support.

That means not all code is executed the same in every runtime. Some might miss certain functions or language features depending on the implementation level of the standard.

That is the reason why transpilers are used. They take the new syntax and convert it to code that can be
executed in targeted runtime environments.

Some transpilers, older versions of Babel specifically, can be configured to support *stage-0*, features. Do **not** do this. You are going to run into problems in the future if the spec changes. This feature has been deprecated from Babel as of version 7.
